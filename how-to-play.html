    <p class="">Ludo is a board and dice game, in which players have to strategize their moves to move towards victory. Surely everyone has played this game in their childhood. A lot of our good memories are attached to this game and get triggered when hearing the name Ludo. </p>
    <p>Ludo originated from a square board game called Pachisi which was initially played by Royal Mughal Emperors. Then in 1896, in England, the name Ludo was officially patented for the game and it has been known since. The simplicity and fast-paced nature of the game attract everyone and it is loved by all ages. Up to 2-4 players can play the game. The basic aim of Ludo is to play the pawns in the decided path and lead them towards the center of the board, in the Home space.. </p>
        <div class="sub_head">Components</div>
        <div class="sub_head" style="font-size: 15px;">The game consists of several components which by default comes within a single set of the game in the market. These components are:</div>
        <p class="m-0">1. A SQUARE BOARD WITH PATHS, HOME SPACE, AND 4 PERSONAL HOME SPACES OF DIFFERENT COLORS DESIGNED ON IT.</p>
        <p class="m-0">2. 4 DIFFERENT COLORED PAWNS. SIMILAR COLORS AS OF THEIR PERSONAL HOME SPACES.</p>
        <p>3. ONE OR TWO DICE.</p>
        <div class="sub_head">How to Play</div>
        <p>Ludo is one of the simplest games ever and learning this game is so fun and easy. Four players choose their respective colors of the pawn and the pawns, in the beginning, are at rest in their Personal Homes. Each player gets 4 pawns and can use any pawn to move forward upon the number of the rolled dice, given that the pawns which they want to move are out of their respective Personal Homes. The dice is rolled and the player who gets the number 6 on their dice moves first. As the game progresses, all the pawns of all the players get out of their Personal Homes and will move in the spaces provided on the board. The main objective of the game is to reach first at the center of the board where the Home space is allocated. But the catch is you can get cut off by another player’s pawn on your way to the center. You can also cut-off anyone’s pawn coming in your way. The cut off pawn returns to their Personal Home and will only get when the rolled dice gives the number 6. If a player gets a 6 on the rolled dice, he/she gets a second chance to roll the dice.</p>
        <p>There are also shared spaces on the track spaces where every pawn is safe from the others and any number of pawns can sit in this space at a time. </p>
        <div class="sub_head">How can you win the game?</div>
        <p>Getting a 6 on the dice is something that can’t be controlled, it purely depends on luck. However, moving the pawns after getting 6 or any numbers on the rolled dice is something that can be controlled. Strategize a few steps ahead in your mind and look out for the smartest move possible when your turn comes up. Always keep an eye out for other pawns as they can cut you off in the middle of your journey towards victory and now you will have to start from the beginning. </p>
        <div class="sub_head" style="font-size: 15px;">Variants of the Ludo Game</div>
        <p>Want to try something new and different while maintaining the classic feels of the Ludo game? Well, we provide a few variants of the game for the players who seek to play something out of the box. </p>
        <div class="sub_head">Variants include:</div>
        <div class="sub_head" style="font-size: 15px;">4 House</div>
        <p>The rules for this game remain the same as of the base game except for the winning condition of this game. The player now has to end up with all 4 of their pawns in the Home space. The player should be the first one to do so. Each player gets 15 sec to roll the dice and move the desired pawn. The pawn gets opened when the rolled dice gives the number 6 on its face. The Timer is a new variation of the game. As the name suggests, a predefined time is set before the game session and the game follows a point system. Each step rewards 1 point and reaching the Home space will reward you 56 points, a single pawn. The pawns at the beginning are open already, you just have to walk them towards the Home space in the given time. When the timer hits 00:00, the player with maximum points wins the game. </p>
        <div class="sub_head" style="font-size: 15px;">1 House</div>
        <p>The game starts normally and sticks to all the basic rules of the Ludo game. The player starts as the dice hits the number 6. Players have to reach the Home space with 1 pawn only. The first player to do so will be declared the winner. Each player gets 15 sec each to roll the dice and play their pawns. Private table Private tables are fully customizable. They can be 4 houses, 1 House, Timer, etc. whatever you desire. You can invite your friends, family, etc. to play with them on this personalized table. You can create your own game. </p>

    <p> A single 52-card deck can be used for a quick shot game. To keep it nice and simple, the chances of winning in the game are 50/50. Players can then choose from two sides of the table, which can be Andar (on the left) or Bahar (on the right). When cutting and distributing cards, the goal is to predict which side of the selected card will have a card with the same number. </p>
    <div class="sub_head">Know the Basic Rules</div>
    <ul class="" style="padding-left:15px;">
      <li>The games start by the dealer dealing one face-up card which he or she places in the middle of the table in front of the player.</li>
      <li>This face-up card is called the game card and it is what will determine how the round is played and when it ends.</li>
      <li> Next, it’s the player’s turn to place his bet. The goal is to predict on which side – andar or bahar – that the next card with the same value will show up.</li>
      <li> After that, the dealer proceeds with dealing one card at the time on each side of the table until a card with the same value as the game card is dealt.</li>
      <li> If the player placed his bet on andar and the same-valued card is dealt on andar he wins but if it’s dealt on the bahar side, he loses.</li>

<p class="cn_regular mt-2">Forming an set with Printed Joker</p>

<h4 class="sub_head">Sort Function</h4>

<p class="cn_regular mt-2">In The Rummy Signal the cards are distributed randomly between all the opponents and appear in the fashion as shown below. You can easily arrange your cards by hitting the sort button. This feature sorts the cards according to their suits in increasing order of their ranks as shown. Using Sort makes it easier for the user to have a quicker understanding of what cards they have, strategize and decide how they want to proceed with the game.

<p class="cn_regular mt-2">Cards after using the Sort feature</p>

<h4 class="sub_head">Declare</h4>

<p class="cn_regular mt-2">Sometimes when your opponent has a valid meld and you need to declare your cards.</p>

<h4 class="sub_head">Drop/Auto-Drop Function</h4>

<p class="cn_regular mt-2">As soon as players have been dealt, you may be able to drop a game if you’re displeased with the cards you’ve received. However, this will give you a bunch of undesirable points, so it needs to be a calculated risk! (Don’t try this on your first date!)
</p>

<h4 class="sub_head">Time-bound</h4>

<p class="cn_regular mt-2">The thing which separates it from offline rummy is that you cannot take your own sweet time for every move. This adds to the thrill of your skill!
</p>

<h4 class="sub_head">Discard a Card</h4>

<p class="cn_regular mt-2">Select the card that you want to discard by clicking on it and hit the discard icon that appears above the card. The discarded card will then move to the Open deck and your opponent may either pick this card or pick a card from Closed Deck in their next turn.
</p>

<p class="cn_regular mt-2">Place a Show</p>

<p class="cn_regular mt-2">Group Cards</p>

      Teen Patti
    </div>
            <p class="text-white">Teen Patti is a popular Indian gambling card game just like poker. It is normally played in a group of 3 to 6 persons and uses&nbsp;a 52-card pack without jokers. Each&nbsp;player is dealt three cards face down. Before the cards are dealt, the&nbsp;<b class="hcolr">boot</b>&nbsp;amount is decided and collected from each player. The boot amount is the minimum stake amount put in the&nbsp;<b class="hcolr">pot</b>, which is the money kept in the centre of the table. As the game progresses the pot money grows and is won by the&nbsp;<b class="hcolr">winner</b>&nbsp;of that hand. Winner is the player who remains in the game till the&nbsp;completion of the hand and has the best hand or the highest hand&nbsp;based on&nbsp;the cards ranking shown below.</p>
            <p class="text-white">Ranking of the cards from high to low is:</p>
            <ol class="" style="padding-left: 15px;">
              <li class="text-white">Trail or Set (three of same rank),</li>
              <li class="text-white">Pure sequence,</li>
              <li class="text-white">Sequence (or run),</li>
              <li class="text-white">Color,</li>
              <li class="text-white">Pair (two cards of same rank), and</li>
              <li class="text-white">High Card.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="text-white">The figure below shows highest to lowest cards of each rank. It should be noted that in a sequence A-K-Q is the highest ranked sequence while A-2-3 is the second highest ranked sequence.</p>
            <img style="border-radius: 6px;margin-bottom: 15px;" src="assets/img/sw.png" alt="">
            <p class="text-white"><b class="hcolr">Playing Teen Patti.</b> Each player contributes the boot money and gets three cards facedown. Now it is the turn of the player next to the dealer in clockwise direction. The player has option to place a bet without seeing the cards <b class="hcolr">(blind)</b> or see the card. When the player sees his card, he/she can play <b class="hcolr">chaal</b> or may have other options depending upon the progress of the game. A player who places a blind bet is referred to as the <b class="hcolr">blind player.</b> A player who places his bet after seeing the cards is referred to as the <b class="hcolr">seen player.</b></p>
            <p class="text-white"><b class="hcolr"><i>Blind Player.</i></b> To be blind player, you must not see your cards. You have options to play <b class="hcolr">Pack, Blind</b> and <b class="hcolr">Show</b> if available. To play Blind put the <b class="hcolr">bet</b> amount in the pot. The Blind bet amount is equal to the current <b class="hcolr">stake</b> amount or twice the current stake amount.  The current stake amount, in case of the first player, is the boot amount. Thus if the first player is a blind player, the player must bet amount equal to the boot amount or twice the boot amount.</p>
            <p class="text-white"><i>Stake Amount.</i> The bet placed by a blind player becomes the stake amount for the next player while half of the bet placed by a seen player becomes the stake amount for the next player. In case of the next blind players, the bet amount can be equal to the stake amount or twice the stake amount.</p>
            <p class="text-white">A blind player can ask for a Show only when there is one opponent remaining in the game. This is a blind show. After asking for show, the cards of both the players become visible and the winner gets the pot.</p>
            <p class="text-white"><b class="hcolr"><i>Seen Player.</i></b> A seen player can play Chaal, Pack or may have other options. The other options that may be available to the seen player are Show and Side Show. Once you have seen your cards, to remain in the game, you must play chaal unless you select any other available option.</p>
            <p class="text-white"><i>(a) Chaal.</i> To remain in the game, a seen player must play Chaal or Side Show if available. For chaal the player must put the bet amount in the bot. The bet amount for a seen player is equal to twice or four times the current stake amount. If the previous player is a blind player, the stake amount for next player is amount bet by the player. If the previous player is a seen player, the stake amount for next player is half the amount bet by the player.</p>
            <p class="text-white"><i>(b) Side Show.</i> A seen player can ask for a Side Show. Side Show means that you wish to compare your cards with the cards of the previous player. You can do this only if the previous  player is also a seen player and there are one or more other players still in the game. For Side Show you put amount equal to twice the current stake in the pot. Your request for the Side Show is conveyed to the previous player. The previous player has option to accept or deny your Side Show request.</p>
            <p class="text-white">If your Side Show request is accepted and the previous player has better cards than you, you must pack. If your cards are better than the previous player, the previous player must pack. After one of you have packed, the turn passes on to the next player.</p>
            <p class="text-white">If your Side Show request is denied, you do not see each other’s cards and both of you remain in the game and the turn passes on to the next player. </p>
            <p class="text-white"><b class="hcolr">Limited Stake and Unlimited Stake Tables.</b>&nbsp;When you play Teen Patti for the first time, you play on a limited stake table. On the first limited stake table that you play, the boot amount is 2, you can play maximum 4 blinds, the maximum Chaal that you can play is 256 and the Pot limit is 2048. When the Pot limit is reached, all players still in the game are forced to show their cards and the winner gets the Pot.</p>
            <p class="text-white">In the next level limited table, the the boot amount is 4, you can play maximum 4 blinds, the maximum Chaal that you can play is&nbsp;512 and the Pot limit is 4096. Players who have played many hands and have many chips play on higher level tables.</p>
